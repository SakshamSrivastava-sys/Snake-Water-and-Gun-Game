Snake, Water and Gun Game (Python)

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Snake, Water, and Gun game developed using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the computer’s choice is generated randomly, and the winner is decided based on predefined game rules.

The project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts such as conditional statements (if-elif-else), loops, functions, user input handling, and the random module. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to help understand basic programming logic and decision-making in Python.

The game follows simple rules:

Snake drinks Water → Snake wins

Water disables Gun → Water wins

Gun kills Snake → Gun wins

After each round, the program displays the user’s choice, the computer’s choice, and the result (win, lose, or draw). The game can be extended further to include multiple rounds, score tracking, or a replay option.
